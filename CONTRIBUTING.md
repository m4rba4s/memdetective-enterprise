# Contributing to Memory Inspector CLI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Memory Inspector CLI! This project welcomes contributions from security researchers, developers, and forensics analysts.

## üéØ Project Goals

Memory Inspector CLI is designed to be a **senior-level, enterprise-grade** memory analysis tool for:
- Security researchers and penetration testers
- Incident response and digital forensics teams
- Malware analysts and reverse engineers
- Red team and blue team operations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC 11+ or Clang 13+
- YARA development libraries
- ncurses development libraries
- Basic knowledge of C11, memory management, and Linux/Windows internals

### Development Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd memory-inspector-cli
make deps-fedora    # Install dependencies on Fedora
make debug         # Build debug version
make test         # Run tests
```

## üìã Code Standards

### Senior-Level Quality Requirements
1. **Memory Safety**: No buffer overflows, proper bounds checking
2. **Thread Safety**: Use proper locking, atomic operations
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error paths, graceful degradation
4. **Security**: Secure coding practices, privilege validation
5. **Performance**: Efficient algorithms, resource management
6. **Portability**: Cross-platform compatibility

### Code Style
- **C11 standard** compliance
- **Snake_case** for functions and variables
- **UPPER_CASE** for constants and macros
- **Comprehensive comments** for public APIs
- **Defensive programming** practices

### Architecture Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns, dependency inversion
- **Platform Abstraction**: OS-specific code isolated in platform layers
- **Modular Design**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Atomic operations, race condition prevention

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Issues and Planning
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Include platform, version, and reproduction steps
- Label appropriately (bug, enhancement, security, etc.)

### 2. Feature Development
- Create feature branch from `main`
- Follow naming convention: `feature/description` or `fix/issue-number`
- Keep commits atomic and well-documented
- Include tests for new functionality

### 3. Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests** for all new functions
- **Integration tests** for workflows
- **Platform tests** on target systems
- **Security tests** for vulnerable code paths
- **Performance tests** for critical paths

### 4. Pull Request Process
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update documentation
- Add changelog entry
- Follow PR template
- Request review from maintainers

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Reporting Security Issues
- **DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Email security@[project-domain] with details
- Allow 90 days for responsible disclosure
- Include proof of concept if applicable

### Security Requirements
- All memory operations must be bounds-checked
- Sensitive data must be securely zeroed
- Race conditions must be prevented
- Privilege escalation must be minimal and documented

## üìö Contribution Areas

### High Priority
- **Windows platform implementation** (Phase 2)
- **Advanced YARA rules** for threat detection
- **Performance optimizations** for large memory regions
- **Additional output formats** (JSON, XML, CSV)
- **Integration tests** with real malware samples

### Medium Priority
- **GUI interface** development
- **Network memory analysis** capabilities
- **Machine learning** anomaly detection
- **Database integration** for large-scale analysis
- **REST API** for remote analysis

### Documentation
- **Usage examples** and tutorials
- **Architecture documentation** improvements
- **Platform-specific** build instructions
- **Performance benchmarking** guides

## üèÜ Recognition

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with documentation or small bug fixes
2. **Ask Questions**: Use discussions for design questions
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Security tools require extensive testing
4. **Think Like an Attacker**: Consider abuse cases and edge conditions
5. **Document Everything**: Future contributors will thank you
