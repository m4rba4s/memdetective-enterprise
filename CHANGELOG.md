- 💾 **Auto-dump engine** for suspicious memory regions
  - Forensics-ready dumps with metadata
  - SHA-256 integrity checking
  - Timestamped output with PID/region info
  - Atomic file operations to prevent corruption
- 🖥️ **Professional CLI interface** with:
  - Colored output with ANSI escape codes
  - Comprehensive argument parsing
  - Multiple verbosity levels (quiet, normal, verbose, debug)
  - Professional security assessment reporting
- 🏗️ **Enterprise-grade architecture**:
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Platform abstraction layer for cross-platform support
  - Thread-safe logging system
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Memory safety guarantees
- 🔒 **Security-first design**:
  - Secure memory buffer handling
  - Race condition prevention
  - Minimal privilege requirements
  - Audit logging capabilities
- 📋 **Comprehensive documentation**:
  - Architecture documentation
  - Senior-level implementation guidelines
  - Build and usage instructions
  - Contributing guidelines
- 🧪 **Testing infrastructure**:
  - Unit test framework
  - Build system with dependency checking
  - Self-validation capabilities

### Technical Details
- **Platform Support**: Linux (Fedora 42+) with full implementation
- **Language**: C11 with GCC 15+ support
- **Dependencies**: YARA library, pthread, ncurses (optional)
- **Architecture**: Modular design with platform abstraction
- **Memory Safety**: Zero buffer overflows, proper bounds checking
- **Performance**: Efficient chunked processing, O(n) algorithms

### Security Features
- **Memory anomaly detection** with statistical analysis
- **Process integrity validation** (PID recycling detection)
- **Secure file operations** with atomic writes
- **Comprehensive logging** for audit trails
- **Fail-safe design** with graceful error handling

### Known Limitations
- Requires elevated privileges for memory reading
- YARA support conditionally compiled
- Windows platform support in development (Phase 2)
- TUI interface placeholder (future enhancement)

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd memory-inspector-cli
make deps-fedora  # Install dependencies
make             # Build release version
./memory-inspector --help
```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Basic memory analysis
./memory-inspector --pid 1234

# With YARA scanning
./memory-inspector --pid 1234 --yara-rules rules.yar

# With auto-dump
./memory-inspector --pid 1234 --auto-dump --output-dir /tmp/dumps

# Verbose analysis
./memory-inspector --pid 1234 --verbose
```
